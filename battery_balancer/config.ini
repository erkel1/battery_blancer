; Configuration for Battery Balancer System

[General]
; Number of batteries in the system. Must be a positive integer.
NumberOfBatteries = 3

; Voltage difference threshold to initiate balancing process (in Volts). 
; Should be a positive float value representing the voltage difference.
VoltageDifferenceToBalance = 0.1

; Duration for which balancing occurs when initiated (in seconds). 
; Must be a positive integer.
BalanceDurationSeconds = 5

; Time to wait between each check for balancing need (in seconds). 
; Should be a positive float, representing the sleep interval.
SleepTimeBetweenChecks = 0.1

; Rest period after a balancing operation before checking again (in seconds). 
; Must be a positive integer, indicating the rest duration.
BalanceRestPeriodSeconds = 60

; Voltage level at which an alarm should be triggered (in Volts). 
; Should be a positive float value representing the alarm threshold.
AlarmVoltageThreshold = 22

; Number of voltage samples to take for averaging. 
; Must be a positive integer.
NumberOfSamples = 2

; Maximum number of retry attempts for reading a battery's voltage. 
; Must be a positive integer.
MaxRetries = 2

; Time interval between sending alert emails (in seconds). 
; Must be a positive integer, used to prevent email flooding.
EmailAlertIntervalSeconds = 3600

; I2C bus number for communication. 
; Must be a non-negative integer.
I2C_BusNumber = 1

; Logging level for the application. 
; Possible values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. 
LoggingLevel = INFO

; Voltage divider ratio used to calculate actual battery voltage from measured voltage.
; This value represents the fraction of the actual battery voltage that is 
; measured by the voltage meter after passing through a voltage divider.
; For example, if the measured voltage is 0.1V and this ratio is 0.01592,
; then the actual battery voltage would be 0.1V / 0.01592 = 6.281V.
; Must be a positive float, typically less than 1.0.
VoltageDividerRatio = 0.01592
