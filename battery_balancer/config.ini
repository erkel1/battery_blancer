; Configuration for Battery Balancer System
; All values should be validated against your specific hardware setup

[General]
; Number of batteries in the system. Must match physical connections (1-3 supported)

; Voltage difference threshold to initiate balancing process (Volts)
; Typical range: 0.05-0.2V for LiFePO4 systems
VoltageDifferenceToBalance = 0.1

; Duration for active balancing when triggered (seconds)
; Prevents over-balancing. Recommended: 5-60s

; Delay between voltage checks (seconds)
; Lower values increase responsiveness but reduce I2C stability
SleepTimeBetweenChecks = 0.1

; Minimum rest period between balancing sessions (seconds)
; Allows system stabilization. Recommended: 60-300s
BalanceRestPeriodSeconds = 60

; High voltage alarm threshold per battery (Volts)
; Should be below BMS cutoff voltage. For 5S LiFePO4: ~3.6V/cell * 5 = 18.0V

; Low voltage alarm threshold per battery (Volts)
; Should be above BMS low-cutoff. For 5S LiFePO4: ~2.8V/cell * 5 = 14.0V
LowVoltageThresholdPerBattery = 18.5

; I2C bus number (0 for Pi 1, 1 for Pi 2-4)
I2C_BusNumber = 1

; Voltage divider ratio: V_measured = V_real * ratio
; Calculate using: R2 / (R1 + R2)
VoltageDividerRatio = 0.01592

; Minimum time between alert emails (seconds)
; Prevents email flooding. 3600 = 1 hour

; Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
LoggingLevel = INFO

SMTP_Port = 587

; Email account credentials
SenderEmail = your_email@gmail.com
RecipientEmail = recipient@example.com
SMTP_User = your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_Password = your_app_specific_password  ; Generate in Gmail security settings

[Calibration]
; Calibration multipliers for voltage sensors
; Measure known voltage and adjust to match: multiplier = V_actual / V_measured
